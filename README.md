# Netflix Content Data Analysis
## 📌 Project Description
This project presents an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Netflix content data using Python. The analysis focuses on uncovering patterns and trends related to content types, genre distribution, release years, and geographic availability.

## 🎯 Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:
- To analyze and compare the distribution of Movies and TV Shows on Netflix
- To identify the most common genres and content categories
-	To examine trends in content production over time
-	To analyze the geographic distribution of Netflix content by country
-	To apply exploratory data analysis techniques on a real-world dataset
-	To demonstrate proficiency in Python-based data analytics
  
## 📊 Dataset Overview
The dataset contains metadata related to Netflix titles and includes the following attributes:
-	Title name
-	Content type (Movie or TV Show)
-	Genre(s)
-	Release year
-	Country of production
-	Date the content was added to Netflix The dataset is suitable for exploratory data analysis, trend identification, and descriptive statistical analysis
  
## 🧪 Methodology
The project follows a structured data analytics workflow:
-	Data loading and initial inspection
-	Data cleaning and preprocessing
-	Handling missing, inconsistent, and duplicated values
-	Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
-	Data visualization of key patterns and trends
-	Interpretation of analytical results
  
## 🛠 Tools and Technologies
-	**Programming Language:** Python
-	**Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
-	**Development Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
  
## 📈 Key Findings
-	The analysis highlights the following insights:
-	Movies constitute a larger portion of Netflix’s catalog compared to TV Shows
-	A limited number of genres dominate the platform’s content library
-	Netflix has experienced significant growth in content production over recent years
-	Netflix content is globally distributed, with higher concentration in specific countries
  
## 🔮 Future Improvements
